# Dealing Cards is a Pain. This Makes It Easier.

Dealing cards manually slows down the game. Shuffling, counting, and distributing takes time, and over the course of a session, that adds up. This app automates card distribution so you can play more hands without breaking the flow of the game.

## Why I Built This

I enjoy playing cards, but I noticed how much time is lost just dealing. With this app, my group was able to play more hands per night while keeping the live table feel—chips, banter, and all. The only thing missing was the hassle of dealing.

## How to Use

It’s pretty intuitive, but here’s the general flow:

1. **Create or join a session.** Share `#sessionId` if creating a session.
2. **Once in the same room, click "Start Gambling!"**
3. **All players receive 2 cards** from the central display once a new hand is started.
4. **The central display pauses three times** (before the Pre-flop, Flop, and Turn) to allow betting to take place.
5. **The session can always be reset** from the main display.

## Here’s How Your Sessions Would Look

- **Main window** in the center.
- **All other displays** are players' phones.

**Main window**:

**All cards are dealt face down**:

## What's Next?  

Moving from a back-end-based system to a **peer-to-peer** model so the app is actually usable not only by me. Stay tuned!
